WIP. DX tool to test react-native components with defined props/state fixtures.

Yep, this brings the [cosmos](https://github.com/skidding/cosmos) for
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) into the
[react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) universe. ;)

Thanks [@skidding](https://twitter.com/skidding)!

TODO:

* [x] Make component props and state editable.
* [ ] Serialize child props and state?
* [ ] Show a ListView of components
* [ ] Show a ListView of components fixtures
